# High-Low-Game


<html><h3>The game is very
simple and short.</h3>

However, the problem is "horizontal" that we need a bit of thinking for this. Each dice I drawed by 9 
lines of string, and we have total 5 dices. To place 5 dices side by side, we need to print 1st lines 
of all 5 dices, then 2nd lines of all 5 dices, ... til 9th lines of all. Unlike Python, in Java, when we just do "System.out.print" with no "/n new line",
it means we are print them in a same line.
