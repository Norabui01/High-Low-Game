# Introduction to my High-Low-Game


<html><h3>This is one of my first Java project in my first Java class runs on console. The game is very
simple and short that everyone can do it easily with the basic learning. However, my professor required 
3D drawing dice's face corresponding to each user or computer's roll in "horizontal" for extra credits!</h3>

I was excited to do that extra part though. Because she required us can just apply the basic learning of 
Java to make the program(no methods), the code seems kind of long. I was suprised that i was the only 
student in my class could do the extra part<^-^>.

It will be very simple if the 3D drawing can be placed vertically. We can just draw each dice by string and 
print them out.

However, the problem is "horizontal" that we need a bit of thinking for this. Each dice I drawed by 9 
lines of string, and we have total 5 dices. To place 5 dices side by side, we need to print 1st lines 
of all 5 dices, then 2nd lines of all 5 dices, ... til 9th lines of all. Unlike Python, in Java, when we just do "System.out.print" with no "/n new line",
it means we are print them in a same line.
